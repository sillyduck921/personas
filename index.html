                <h2>Brown University Mail Pick-Up Kiosk</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="body-wrapper">
                <h4>The Brown Mail Pick-Up Kiosk allows Brown students to easily pick up their packages and 
                    mail sent to their mailbox in Page-Robinson Hall. The touch-screen interface prompts 
                    users to type in their Brown ID or swipe their physical Brown ID card. Users have the option 
                    to pick up their mail either now or later. The kiosk simplifies the mail pick-up process, as 
                    students need only to swipe their ID card to determine which packages have arrived to pick up.

                <h4>
                    After observing Brown students filter in through the sliding doors of Page-Robinson and using the mail
                    pick-up kiosk, here are some initial observations:
                </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li class="list">All users swiped their ID card instead of typing in their Brown ID</li>
                    <li class="list">All users used the mail kiosk outside the mailroom instead of the screen interface inside the mailroom</li>
                    <li class="list">All users selected the “Pick Up Now” option and proceeded into the mailroom</li>
                    <li class="list">Most users did not have to wait in line to swipe their ID</li>
                    <li class="list">Some users swiped their ID card up and down multiple times</li>
                    <li class="list">One user swiped their Brown ID and the search bar was filled with a few dots. 
                        This was an indication that they did not swipe their ID card properly. 
                        They flipped it over and swiped it again and yet again it did not process. 
                        They walked to the other screen and successfully swiped their ID card</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    Additionally, I prepared some user research questions to ask select Brown students about their experience with the
                    mail pick-up interface:
                </h4>
                <ol>
                    <li class="list">How would you intuitively go about using the kiosk?</li>
                    <li class="list">How effective are the instructions posted around the kiosk?</li>
                    <li class="list">Was anything surprising or did not perform as expected?</li>
                    <li class="list">Was the interface easy to understand?</li>
                    <li class="list">What was the one thing you liked the most about the design?</li>
                    <li class="list">What was the one thing you disliked the most about the design?</li>
                    <li class="list">If you could change one thing about the design, what would it be?</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>
                    After collecting feedback from users, here is a summary of their responses:
                </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li class="list">Users generally agreed that the kiosk and screen interface is easy to use and understand. They thought the 
                        instructions coupled with seeing how other people use the kiosk give new users enough information to be able 
                        to successfully navigate the interface</li>
                    <li class="list">Users are generally frustrated that the swiping mechanism is glitchy and does not always work. Specifically, swiping 
                        their ID card sometimes does not process correctly or takes a long time to read the card</li>
                    <li class="list">To improve the kiosk, one user suggested that it would be helpful to improve the functionality of the screens or replace 
                        the card readers with newer ones. They agreed that swiping your ID card to receive your mail is easy, but the machines 
                        often do not perform at their best</li>
                    <li class="list">To improve the kiosk, another user suggested that it would be helpful to know your place in the pick-up queue to understand 
                        how long it will take for mail services to say your name. This would perhaps guide them to choose the “Cancel” option to 
                        pick up later if they were in a hurry and did not have time to wait for their mail</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="persona-text">Suzie has had a long day full of classes and meetings, and she wants to pick up her packages at the mailroom before it closes at 5:00 pm. 
                    After she swipes her Brown ID at the pick-up kiosk, she does not know what her packages are and how long she needs to wait before her name is called. 
                    Many users expressed frustration with the unknown wait time to pick up one’s package, and one user pointed out that it would be helpful to know 
                    more about the content of the packages such that they may make a better-informed decision on whether to pick it up now or later.</h4>

                    Sam is excited to pick up his package (a new water bottle to stay hydrated) and strolls into Page-Robinson Hall. Sam struggles with swiping his Brown ID, 
                    as the card reader reads it incorrectly multiple times. He feels bad for holding up the line of people behind him, so he switches to the other screen in 
                    hopes that it will process correctly. Many users pointed out the glitchiness of the card readers and screen interfaces, as their IDs often do not process 
                    correctly. This was a significant point of frustration amongst users of the mail pick-up kiosk.
